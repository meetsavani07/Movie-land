# In This code
  1. Hooks --> useState, useEffect
    ● React Hooks provide functional components with the ability to use states and manage side effects. They were first introduced in React 16.8, and allow           developers to hook into the state and other React features without having to write a class. They provide a cleaner and more concise way to handle state         and side effects in React applications
